## Dataset Information :
#### Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.The first 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei.Link to dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Prognostic)
